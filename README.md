## Getting Started

The project is a movie review app, with this app, the user will be able to write reviews of
their favorite movies and guests will be able to react to the review with a positive reaction or a negative reaction. The business logic, services and frontend components are already completed, all we have to do is complete the API.

1. Generate repository from this [template](https://github.com/hyper63/api-workshop/generate)

1. Launch env using gitpod 

Click the button below to start a new development environment:

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/from-referrer/)

1. Create a `.env` file and add your hyper connect string to the file

```
HYPER=hyperio://key:secret@host/app
```

## OpenAPI Editor

In this workshop, we will use https://editor.swagger.io/ to build our API documentation.
